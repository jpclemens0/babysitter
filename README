This project implements a solution to the Babysitter Kata along with unit tests. The history of the implementation can be followed by examining the GitHub commits.

All unit tests can be run with ‘python -m unittest discover’ executed from the root project directory.

The main program sets the parameters defining a single babysitting job and calculates the pay for that job. It can be run with ‘python main.py’ executed from the root project directory.

Note that the rule about pay for full hours only is ambiguous.  I have interpreted this to mean that only full hours are considered at each level of pay throughout the night.  So if the babysitter works 2 hours and 59 minutes before bedtime they are only paid for for 2 hours.  Then the extra 59 minutes are discarded and the pay between bedtime and midnight is calculated based on full hours between bedtime and midnight.  And so forth.
